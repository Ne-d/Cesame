Basic Feature goals:

- Gather monitoring data:
    - GPU: 5 / 33 done lessgoooooo
	- Probably more, there's tons of stuff exposed by NVML

    - Others:
	- Memory (RAM) transfer rate / usage time percentage (maybe)
	- Disk / SSD space used / free / total / delta (useless but cool)
	- Disk / SSD transfer rate / usage time percentage

- Display the data:
    - Translucent window support (Qt stuff probably)

- Quality of life / compatibility features:
    - Automatic selection of correct hwmon devices (cpu temp), how the FUCK do I do that?
    - AMD GPUs exist ? Well I'm screwed. Intel ain't no way tho.

Le refactoring:

- Namespaces, for fuck's sake
-
- Time, and it's gonna take a lot of it.
- Line graphs cause seriously they're terrible right now.
