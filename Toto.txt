Basic Feature goals:


- Gather monitoring data:
    - GPU: 5 / 33 done lessgoooooo
	- Probably more, there's tons of stuff exposed by NVML

    - Others:
	- Memory (RAM) transfer rate / usage time percentage (maybe)
	- Disk / SSD space used / free / total / delta (useless but cool)
	- Disk / SSD transfer rate / usage time percentage

- Display the data

    - Bar Graph Rendering
    - Translucent window support (fuck you XLib) (not you Cairo, you're cool)
